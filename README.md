# CyTOF-PlotViewer

Plots log histograms for user-selected parameters of FCS files like Fluidigm's PlotViewer program.

e.g. like this:

 I realised that the PlotViewer program, supplied with Fluidigm's CyTOF software, although limited, is quite nice in the way it shows histograms of the data.
  
  I set about trying to recreate this so that I could quickly view every (or a selection of) parameter(s) in FCS files.
  
  I'm quite happy with how it turned out.
